Description:
Developed a machine learning model to predict customer likelihood of purchasing a new Wellness Tourism package, improving marketing efficiency for "Trips & Travel.Com". Analyzed a dataset of 4,888 customer records with 20 features, addressing an 18% historical purchase rate for holiday packages.

Key Achievements:

Conducted comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering, handling missing values across 8 features and creating a new 'TotalVisiting' feature.
Implemented and compared 5 classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and AdaBoost.
Utilized RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, focusing on Random Forest and Gradient Boost Classifiers.
Achieved a top-performing model using Gradient Boost Classifier with an accuracy of 90.26% on the test set.
Improved the AUC-ROC score to 0.9026, indicating excellent model discrimination between classes.
Demonstrated strong model performance with precision of 0.8387, recall of 0.7047, and F1-score of 0.8966 on the test set.
